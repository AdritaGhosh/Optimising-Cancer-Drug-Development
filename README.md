# Optimising Cancer Drug Development using Machine Learning
This repository hosts the implementation and documentation for a research project exploring machine learning-based prediction of adverse events in cancer drug discovery.
The project integrates QSAR modeling, ensemble learning, and transfer learning to identify safe and effective lead compounds early in the development process, reducing costs and improving patient outcomes.
## Overview
Traditional cancer drug discovery is slow, expensive, and has a low success rate (~6%).
This project applies Machine Learning (ML) to accelerate early-stage research by predicting potential adverse events (AEs) in candidate molecules before clinical testing.
The model integrates Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) features, large molecular datasets, and state-of-the-art ML techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost, Deep Neural Networks) to produce reliable toxicity and efficacy predictions.
