# Optimising Cancer Drug Development using Machine Learning
This project applies Machine Learning (ML) to enhance cancer drug discovery by predicting adverse drug events during early development. Through QSAR modelling, ensemble learning, and transfer learning, it builds a robust safety model capable of identifying safe, effective lead compounds and reducing drug attrition rates.
