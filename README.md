# Optimising Cancer Drug Development using Machine Learning
This project applies Machine Learning (ML) to enhance cancer drug discovery by predicting adverse drug events during early development. Through QSAR modelling, ensemble learning, and transfer learning, it builds a robust safety model capable of identifying safe, effective lead compounds and reducing drug attrition rates.
## Design of New Ideas and Approach
A new ML-QSAR hybrid framework is proposed, combining molecular descriptors from SMILES data, ensemble learning, and transfer learning for robust safety and efficacy prediction.
Key steps include:
* Generating domain-specific features (PAE, Class, Adverse Event)
* Dataset segmentation (Antagonist and Viability subsets)
* Model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP)
* Ensemble stacking and transfer learning for generalization
Ethical and legal compliance (GDPR, HIPAA) is emphasized along with commercial scalability and reliability.
